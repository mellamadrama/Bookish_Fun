# Bookish Fun

Our project is a game website for people who love to read or have an interest in reading. The website caters to people of different ages, ranging from children to adults. The game we decided on for the website is matching quotes to the books they came from. There are 2 different game modes that users can choose from. The first is an Education Game mode, where the quotes will mostly be from literature books. This game mode is to help literature students study and memorize quotes in a more fun manner. The third Game Mode is Young Adults. This is catered to more mature and older readers who read more and read genres like romance, fantasy, young adults, and many others. It is slightly different compared to the other three game modes, as this one is matching the picture/character to the manhwa/manhua, instead of quotes.

Users will get three tries to guess the correct answer and will be rewarded with points if they get the correct answers, or else they can decide to move on to the next question or exit the game. At the end of the whole game, the number of points earned will be displayed for users to see. Links to the books featured in the quiz are displayed before playing the game. This is so that if they are interested in the books and quotes they saw in the game, they will be able to look it up easily. We hope that our game website will encourage more people to read, and those who already read to find new books that might interest them.

## Design Process

We wanted to make this website aesthetic without overwhelming users. The simple user interface helps engage players and immerse them into the realm of books. Since our website is targeted towards book lovers, we added well-known books to the quotes quiz, that those who are avid readers will appreciate, and for those who are new readers to discover bestselling titles in a fun way. The quotes in the quiz can entice players to find out more about the books and allow them to expand their reading lists.

With more and more readers often encountering a reading slump, this website can hopefully motivate and bring back more readers, as well as encourage the younger generation to find interest in reading books again. With our fun quotes quizzes, we hope to bring in more readers who are passionate about reading into the world of books.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Having an account - Allows the user to stock up and keep track of the number of points they have, which can give users a sense of accomplishment. 
- Education Game Mode - Allows literature students to recap on quotes from different popular literature books. It also exposes students to other literature books that might peak their interest.
- Young Adult Game Mode - Allows players to explore different books, and getting a sneak peak into key quotes/moments from the different books. This feature aims to encourage players to read the featured books, and even encourage non-readers to try picking up a book from the featured list and reading it. Ultimately this feature serves to help current readers to find new books that they might be interested in, and to encourage more people to read.

### Features Left to Implement
- Adding more game modes - Allows us to reach out to more groups of readers, no matter how niche, and building a community of readers.
- Adding a leaderboard - Allows players to be able to compare themselves with others, and encouraging to play the game more.
- Regularly updating questions - Adding more and more books to the game, allowing for up-and-coming authors to also be featured. It also helps to spice up the gameplay.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
