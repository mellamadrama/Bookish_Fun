# Bookish Fun

Our project is a game website for people who love to read or have an interest in reading. The website caters to people of different ages, ranging from children to adults. The game we decided on for the website is matching quotes to the books they came from. There are 2 different game modes that users can choose from. The first is an Education Game mode, where the quotes will mostly be from literature books. This game mode is to help literature students study and memorize quotes in a more fun manner. The second Game Mode is Young Adults. This is catered to more mature and older readers who read more and read genres like romance, fantasy, young adults, and many others. It is slightly different compared to the other three game modes, as this one is matching the picture/character to the manhwa/manhua, instead of quotes.

Users will get three tries to guess the correct answer and will be rewarded with points if they get the correct answers, or else they can decide to move on to the next question or exit the game. At the end of the whole game, the number of points earned will be displayed for users to see. Links to the books featured in the quiz are displayed before playing the game. This is so that if they are interested in the books and quotes they saw in the game, they will be able to look it up easily. We hope that our game website will encourage more people to read, and those who already read to find new books that might interest them.

## Design Process

We wanted to make this website aesthetic without overwhelming users. The simple user interface helps engage players and immerse them into the realm of books. Since our website is targeted towards book lovers, we added well-known books to the quotes quiz, that those who are avid readers will appreciate, and for those who are new readers to discover bestselling titles in a fun way. The quotes in the quiz can entice players to find out more about the books and allow them to expand their reading lists.

With more and more readers often encountering a reading slump, this website can hopefully motivate and bring back more readers, as well as encourage the younger generation to find interest in reading books again. With our fun quotes quizzes, we hope to bring in more readers who are passionate about reading into the world of books.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Having an account - Allows the user to stock up and keep track of the number of points they have, which can give users a sense of accomplishment. 
- Education Game Mode - Allows literature students to recap on quotes from different popular literature books. It also exposes students to other literature books that might peak their interest.
- Young Adult Game Mode - Allows players to explore different books, and getting a sneak peak into key quotes/moments from the different books. This feature aims to encourage players to read the featured books, and even encourage non-readers to try picking up a book from the featured list and reading it. Ultimately this feature serves to help current readers to find new books that they might be interested in, and to encourage more people to read.

### Features Left to Implement
- Adding more game modes - Allows us to reach out to more groups of readers, no matter how niche, and building a community of readers.
- Adding a leaderboard - Allows players to be able to compare themselves with others, and encouraging to play the game more.
- Regularly updating questions - Adding more and more books to the game, allowing for up-and-coming authors to also be featured. It also helps to spice up the gameplay.

## Testing

### Homepage
- The homepage is the main page. When you first enter the page, you will see the name of the website and the navbar. The navbar contains hyperlinks to Home, About Us, Game Modes, Profile and Points. Under that is the auttomated slide show of book quotes. You can choose to scroll down the Homepage to look at the other sections, like the About Us and Game Modes, or click on the hyperlinks on the navbar, which would take you to those sections of the pages.

- The above is how it would look like on a desktop screen, while as it gets smaller to a mobile screen, the only thing that changes for all pages a like with navbar is that it changes into a dropdown menu.

#### About Us
- The About Us page has a quick summary of what we wish to bring to users and the reason for our website/game. This section is for users to understand what the website is about and what is featured. After the two paragraphs of the reason for our website and target audience, there is a "PLAY NOW" button that allows for users to navigate to the Game Modes section of the main page. 

- The desktop and mobile version of the website is the same, the only difference is the size of the screen and the dropdown menu when the screen is in mobile view.

#### Game Modes
- The Game Mode page is an option page for users, where they can choose which game mode "Education" or "Young Adult" they want to play. They can just click on either box and it would lead them to the game mode they choose.

- When the screen is in desktop view, the two options are placed side by side, while in the mobile view the options are in a column with the "Education" game mode being on the top and the "Young Adult" game mode being at the bottom.

### Education Game
- The Education Game is a page where users will enter when they choose the "Education" game mode in the Game Modes page. This page will shows a message that says the user as choosen the game along with an are you ready messagae. At the bottom of it is a "PLAY" button, where if they click on the button, it would bring them to a loading page and then the quiz.

- Then at the bottom is a section where the books of the quotes tested are showed with hyperlinks that would take them to the goodreads page about the book.

- In desktop view the message is below the navbar, with the button being below that, and the hyperlink section being right at the bottom left corner. While in the mobile view, everything is still the same except for the dropdown menu and the hyperlink section is in the bottom middle of the page. The loading page does not change.

### Young Adult Game
- The Young Adult Game is a page where users will enter when they choose the "Young Adult" game mode in the Game Modes page. This page will shows a message that says the user as choosen the game along with an are you ready messagae. At the bottom of it is a "PLAY" button, where if they click on the button, it would bring them to a loading page and then the quiz.

- Then at the bottom is a section where the books of the quotes tested are showed with hyperlinks that would take them to the goodreads page about the book.

- In desktop view the message is below the navbar, with the button being below that, and the hyperlink section being right at the bottom left corner. While in the mobile view, everything is still the same except for the dropdown menu and the hyperlink section is in the bottom middle of the page. The loading page does not change.

### Edu and YA Game Questions
- After clicking on the "PLAY" button, and going through the loading page, you will end up in either the Edu or the YA Game QUestions page. This is where the game quiz is for users to play, where they will guess which books the quotes came from, depending on which game mode was previosuly choosen.

- If users choose the Edu game mode, then the quotes would come fron literature books to help them memorise quotes for their literature classes, in a more fun and interactive way. 

- If users choose the YA game mode, then the quotes would be from young adult books, which would just be a fun game for them to guess which quotes are from their favourite books, or to entice them to read new books from quotes that they have never read before.

- The navbar for this page is different as at the right is an exit hyperlink button, where if users where to click on it, the points earned in the game would be reset and it would bring the users to the home page game modes section. Then in the middle and the right is a hyperlink button of the specific game mode choosen and the points earch throughtout the game. When either button is pressed, the game will immediately reset.

- The points on the right side will display everytime the user gets a question correct or wrong, where it will go up or down by one point. When a user gets a total of 3 wrong tries, the game will end and the user will be directed into a different page where the final points earned will be shown. Or if the user where to get a total of 20 points the game will automatically also end and the same page as previously mentioned will be shown.

- The middle of the page below the navbar is the quote and the 4 options where users can choose which one is the right answer.

- In desktop view the layout is the question and quote below the navbar, and the 4 options placed in two rows and two columns like a rectangle, while in mobile view the only thing that is different is the dropdown menu and the options are in one single column.

### End Of Game
- After garnering 20 points, users will see the End Of Game page, which congratulates them and adds the points earned from the game to their profile.

- In mobile view, the navigation bar simply becomes a dropdown bar and showing the user that they are in the End of Game page, whereas in the desktop view, the navigation bar is at the top as usual. 

### Profile
- The Profile page shows the users username and points they have earned so far. It also allows for users to log out of the account, or to login/signup if the user is currently without an account and playing on a guest account.

- In desktop view, the navigation bar is displayed in its entirety at the top, whereas in mobile view, it is displayed as a dropdown bar with the header showing the user that they are currently in the profile page. 

### Login
- The Login page is where users can log into the account after logging out and needing to sign back in. It requires for the user to enter the username and password tied to the account. If the user enters data that is not in the database, a notification pops up telling the user that the username or account does not exist. 

- In desktop view, the "username:" and "password:" are beside the input box, whereas in mobile view, they are above the input box. The navigation bar also switches to a dropdown in mobile view, with the header telling the user that you are in the login page. 

### Sign Up
- The Sign Up page is where users can sign up and make a new account if they do not have one. The only way to get to this page is when you go to the Profile page and click the "Log Out" button and then go into the Log In page and click on the "Don't have an account?" which would bring you to the Sign Up page.

- In desktop view, the "username:" and "password:" are beside the input box, whereas in mobile view, they are above the input box. 

### Points
- The Points page is where the total number of points the user has gained is displayed. It is below the navbar in a coloured box, and a background image. It is the same layout of both desktop and mobile view, with the only difference again being the dropdown menu in mobile view.

### Bugs
- On Github pages, the background for points does not load (even though it works on live server when opened from vscode therefore it is probably a github issue)
- On Github pages, the points for the account are oddly resetted even though in live server it links perfectly with the database.
